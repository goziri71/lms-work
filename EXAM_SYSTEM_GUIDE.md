# Exam Management System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The exam system extends the LMS with a comprehensive examination platform that:

- **Auto-syncs quiz questions** to an exam bank
- **Supports random question selection** per student attempt
- **Handles both objective and theory questions**
- **Auto-grades objective questions** and provides manual grading for theory
- **Ensures unique question sets** for each student

---

## Architecture

### Database Design

All exam-related tables are stored in the **Library DB** (`wsp_library`):

1. **Question Bank** (`question_bank`, `question_objective`, `question_theory`)

   - Central repository of all questions
   - Auto-populated from quizzes
   - Tagged with difficulty, topic, source

2. **Exam Definition** (`exams`, `exam_items`)

   - Exam metadata and settings
   - Question count templates (not pre-selected questions)
   - Manual or random selection mode

3. **Exam Delivery** (`exam_attempts`, `exam_answers_objective`, `exam_answers_theory`)
   - Per-student attempts with unique question sets
   - Auto-graded objective answers
   - Manual grading for theory answers

### Auto-Sync Flow

```
Quiz Question Created/Updated â†’ Auto-sync to question_bank
Quiz Question Deleted â†’ Auto-delete from question_bank
```

### Random Selection Flow

```
Student starts exam â†’
  System selects N random questions from bank â†’
  Shuffles and assigns to exam_items (with attempt_id) â†’
  Student gets unique question set
```

## Migration & Setup

### 1. Sync Exam Tables

```bash
node sync-exam-tables.js
```

### 2. Migrate Existing Quizzes to Exam Bank

```bash
node migrate-quizzes-to-bank.js
```

This will import all existing quiz questions into the exam bank.

---

## How It Works

### Quiz Auto-Sync

When staff creates/updates/deletes quiz questions:

1. **Create**: Question is automatically added to `question_bank`
2. **Update**: Question is updated in `question_bank`
3. **Delete**: Question is removed from `question_bank`

### Random Question Selection

When a student starts an exam with `selection_mode: "random"`:

1. System counts available questions:

   - Objective questions: 100 in bank
   - Theory questions: 50 in bank

2. Exam specifies:

   - `objective_count: 30`
   - `theory_count: 5`

3. System randomly selects:

   - 30 random objective questions
   - 5 random theory questions

4. System shuffles and creates `exam_items` with `attempt_id`

5. **Each student gets a different set!**

### Grading Flow

1. **Objective questions**: Auto-graded on submit
2. **Theory questions**: Staff manually grades
3. **Final score**: Calculated when all theory answers are graded
4. **Attempt status**:
   - `in_progress` â†’ `submitted` â†’ `graded`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create quiz with questions â†’ Check question_bank
- [ ] Update quiz question â†’ Check question_bank updates
- [ ] Delete quiz question â†’ Check question_bank removes it
- [ ] Create exam with random mode
- [ ] Student 1 starts exam â†’ Note their questions
- [ ] Student 2 starts exam â†’ Verify different questions
- [ ] Submit objective answers â†’ Check auto-grading
- [ ] Submit theory answers â†’ Grade manually

## Notes

1. **Cross-DB References**: Exam tables are in Library DB but reference students/courses in LMS DB (soft references via IDs)

2. **Performance**: Random selection uses Fisher-Yates shuffle for unbiased randomization

3. **Security**: All endpoints validate:

   - Staff owns the course
   - Student is enrolled
   - Exam time window

4. **Scalability**: Question bank grows over time as more quizzes are created
